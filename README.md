# 📊 Student Performance Analyzer

A **Python-based Student Grading and Analytics System** that simulates student data, evaluates academic performance, and generates insightful reports using data science libraries.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **performance analyzer** built using **NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**.  
It generates realistic academic data for students, calculates grades, and produces both **individual student report cards** and a **faculty-level performance analysis**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- Data generation
- Data processing and analysis
- Grade calculation logic
- Performance visualization

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Fake Data Generation**
   - Creates academic records for **50 students**
   - Uses `numpy` and `random` for realistic score distribution

2. **Grade Calculation**
   - Uses `pandas` to process marks
   - Assigns grades based on calculated performance

3. **Reports Generated**
   - 📄 Individual Student Report Card
   - 📈 Faculty-Level Performance Summary

4. **Visualization**
   - Graphs and charts generated using `matplotlib`
